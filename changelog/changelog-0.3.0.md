## Version 0.3.0

May 23rd 2022: ðŸ—Ž the tenth draft strengthens documentation and localization.

* Requirement for localization made explicit in Create reusable and portable code.
* Documentation of governance changed from a SHOULD to a MUST.
* Replace the very subjective (and hard to test) "contributions MUST be small" with requirement to document expectation in contributing guidelines and focus on a single issue.
* Community translations now linked in the footer.
* Revert "Replace BPMN svg with Mermaid flowchart".
* Many minor clarifications to language and sentences made more simple.
* Some hyperlinks updated.
