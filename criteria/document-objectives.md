# Document codebase objectives

## Requirements

* The codebase MUST contain documentation of its objectives – like a mission and goal statement – that is understandable by developers and designers so that they can use or contribute to the codebase.
* The components out of which the codebase SHOULD be composed MUST be documented by their functional isolation.
* Codebase documentation SHOULD clearly describe the connections between policy objectives and codebase objectives.
* The codebase MAY contain documentation of its objectives for the general public.

## Why this is important

Documenting codebase objectives:

* provides an easy way for people to decide whether this codebase, or one of its components, is interesting for them now or in the future.
* helps scope and isolate your own development.
* improves maintainability and reusability.
* channels (the improvements on the existing) functionality into logically isolated chunks.
* clearly communicates to other stakeholders and contributors what the codebase, and the individual components it is composed from, is for.

## What this does not do

* Guarantee that the codebase achieves the stated objective(s).
* Guarantee contributions to the codebase.
* Prevent other codebases from attempting to achieve the same objectives.
* Guarantee that components are generic enough to be reused in any context.

## How to test

There is an entry for the codebase objectives, mission or goal in the codebase documentation.

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Add the policy objectives to the codebase documentation, for example in the `README`.
* Include relevant policies which impact the community, codebase, and development like value and ethics based policies, for example accessibility or equal opportunity.

## Management: what you need to do

* Add the organizational and business objectives to the codebase documentation, for example in the `README`.
* Watch for a manageable scope of project development.

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Add the technology and design objectives to the codebase documentation, for example in the `README`.
* Design solutions into logically meaningfull and isolated chunks that can be reused into different contexes.
