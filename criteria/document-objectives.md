# Document your objectives

## Requirements

* The codebase MUST contain documentation of its objectives – like a mission and goal statement – that is understandable by designers and developers so that they can use or contribute to the codebase.
* The codebase SHOULD contain documentation of its objectives understandable by policy makers and management.
* The codebase MAY contain documentation of its objectives for the general public.

## Why this is important

Documenting your objectives:

* provides an easy way for people to decide whether this codebase is interesting for them now or in the future.
* helps scope your own development.
* clearly communicates to other stakeholders and contributors what the codebase is for.

## What this does not do

* Guarantee that the codebase achieves the stated objective(s).
* Guarantee contributions to the codebase.
* Prevent other codebases from attempting to achieve the same objectives.

## How to test

There is an entry for the codebase objectives, mission or goal in the codebase documentation.

## Policy makers: what you need to do

* Add the policy objectives to the codebase documentation, for example in the `README`.
* Include relevant policies which impact the community, codebase, and development like value and ethics based policies, for example accessibility or equal opportunity.

## Management: what you need to do

* Add the organizational and business objectives to the codebase documentation, for example in the `README`.

## Developers and designers: what you need to do

* Add the technology and design objectives to the codebase documentation, for example in the `README`.
